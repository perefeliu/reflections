What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A folder with metadata is created. No track of any folder is done until you do something else. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the folder that are about to be commited but 
they haven't been yet created. Working directory is any 
directory, I guess. A repository is a fully functionning file 
versionning. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the command git add to add only the changed files 
to the staging area. staging area is an state between working 
directory and a commit. Once all your files to be commited 
are in the staging area, you can commit.



What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Whenever you want to create a different version of your code, 
for example, a different color, or an experiment, you can 
create a branch to do it. Even if you keep modifying the 
original game, you will be able then to merge them.
