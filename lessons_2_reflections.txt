What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A folder with metadata is created. No track of any folder is done until you do something else. 


How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the folder that are about to be commited but 
they haven't been yet created. Working directory is any 
directory, I guess. A repository is a fully functionning file 
versionning.
