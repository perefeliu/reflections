When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Sometimes may be interesting to collaborate with other people, so it is a good way to use remote repositories. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather 
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?

I don't know. I don't see why it is not good to automatically pull changes. I understand that push should be manual. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?


forkk is used when you want to have an exact copy of a 
repository belonging to someone else. Clone makes a copy of a 
repository. in this case you could make a copy of the 
repository that you just forked. a branch is a sort of path 
that is made of commits from everybody that is collaborating. 


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

having a copy of the last known state of the remote in your computer makes it more easy to track the project but also makes it easier to merge or resolve conflicts. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without git or github, collaborating would be different. For instance, the project should be splitted into independent functions in order to avoid possible conflits. It would be easier to merge, but work would be separated unequaly.
